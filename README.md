# Machine Test for MERN Stack Developer

## Overview
This project is a **MERN Stack-based Machine Test** that includes user authentication, agent management, and CSV file upload with task distribution. The frontend is built using **Vite** and communicates with a Node.js backend.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT)

## **Features**

### **1. User Authentication**
- Secure login system using JWT.
- Role-based authentication for admin.
- Session management with automatic token refresh.

### **2. Agent Management**
- Add agent with his info like name, email, mobile number with country code.
- Display a list of registered agents.

### **3. CSV File Processing & Task Distribution**
- Upload CSV/XLSX files with data validation.
- Automatic task distribution among agents.

### **4. Dashboard & UI Enhancements**
- Interactive dashboard displaying agent statistics.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI.

### **5. Data Persistence & Security**
- Store agent and task data securely in MongoDB.
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
- Secure API endpoints with authentication middleware.
